NicInfo is a general purpose, command line Registry Data Access Protocol (RDAP) client released under 
an open source, ISC derivative BSD style license. RDAP is an HTTP-based RESTful protocol defined by 
the IETF as a replacement for Whois. 

The general usage of this software from the command line is "nicinfo QUERY_VALUE" where the 
QUERY_VALUE is an IP address, domain name, autonomous system number, name server host name, 
or entity identifier. NicInfo will attempt to determine the most appropriate RDAP server to query 
and follow redirects to other RDAP servers as needed.

## Features

NicInfo has the following features:

* Query type detection: it will attempt to determine what type of query is needed based on the supplied query value.
* Plain text output: default output is a text version of the RDAP results.
* JSON output: the RDAP JSON can be passed directly to a calling program for intergration with scripts with
the ability to select specific JSON values.
* Multiple output controls: the amount of text detail and process execution can be varied and sent to different files.
* A Built-in cache: RDAP queries are cached.
* Bootstrapping using the IANA bootstrap files or by using a
bootstrap server.
* Demonstration queries: a set of built-in queries and results are provided for demonstration purposes.

The following is an example of using NicInfo:

# Demonstration Queries

Demonstration queries are available with the --demo option, which will seed the cache with

```

After the cache has been seeded, you will be presented with a list of example queries which will 
pull information from the cache.
